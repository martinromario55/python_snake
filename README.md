# python_snake

Install the `pygame` library

- `pip install pygame`

## How the Code Works:
1. **Initialization**: Initializes the pygame library, sets up colors, screen dimensions, and other configurations.

2. **Game Loop**:
- Handles user input to move the snake.
- Updates the snake's position and checks for collisions with the screen boundaries and itself.
- Checks if the snake has eaten the food, in which case the snake grows in length and a new food item is placed randomly.

3. **Game Over**: Displays a message when the snake crashes and allows the player to either quit or restart the game.

> You can run this script, and a window will open with the Snake game. Use the arrow keys to control the snake.
